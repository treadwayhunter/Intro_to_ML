# Intro to Machine Learning
---

## Description
This repository contains coursework from my introductory Machine Learning course where we focused on supervised and unsupervised learning using Scikit-Learn, with code written with python notebooks. In the ML directory, there are subdirectories for each of our major homework assignments. Datasets for these assignments were provided by the Professor. All directories except HW7 contain the dataset.

The ML_Project directory contains a team project, where we had to research and submit a project proposal that had to be approved by the professor. The project had to meet various standards of difficulty and quality before approval. The dataset had to be found and chosen by the team, and the Professor had no hand in selecting or providing datasets other than for meeting the given standards. (rows * columns) >= 10 million

## ML Homework
---
### HW0
A first week, introductory module for python, to include numpy, seaborn, and pandas. This assignment was more for learning the basics of the python modules we would be using throughout the semester, and was especially useful for students who may not have had exposure to python.

### HW1
The objective of this assignment to gain familiarity with sci-kit learn, and to implement the KNN (k-nearest neighbors) algorithm.

PDF submission: [hw1.pdf](ML/htl17/HW1/HW1.pdf)

### HW2
This assignment covered linear regression.

PDF submission: [hw2.pdf](ML/htl17/HW2/HW2.pdf)

### HW3
This assignment continued the previous assignment into multiple linear regression.

PDF submission: [hw3.pdf](ML/htl17/HW3/HW3.pdf)

### HW4
The object of this assignment was to utilize Logistic Regression and KNN classification methods.

PDF submission: [hw4.pdf](ML/htl17/HW4/HW4.pdf)

### HW5
This assignment covered the comparision between Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines.

PDF submission: [hw5.pdf](ML/htl17/HW5/HW5.pdf)

### HW6
This assignment spent extra time on data processing. Up to this point, a lot of our data was cultivated for us. At this point, we were expected to perform data processing to make data usable for ML.
We also covered Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Classifiers.

PDF submission: [hw6.pdf](ML/htl17/HW6/HW6.pdf)

### HW7
This assignment covered Deep Learning concepts we had briefly learned in class. Instead of the sci-kit learn module, we used the tensorflow framework.

The Project Submission file contains information about my personal contribution to the project, as well as a project summary and project statement.

The data for this project was provided by the University of New Brunswick, with differing versions of the data from their personal website and other versions on Kaggle.
